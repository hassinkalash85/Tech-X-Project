   <h1>Life Being Free After Ten Years</h1>
   <h2>A Living Man in Three Worlds.</h2>
   <p>Gang affiliation was at a very early age. I grew up around street and international gangs. I ended up being affiliated with both.
   Street gangs are usually around where you live at the time. Some are even made in places like juvenile detention centers and prison.</p>
   <p><li>Detention:</li></p>
   <p><li>Correctional Facilities:</li></p>

   <P>You learn everything that happens in the streets from sitting and watching to being active in those activities.
   Your encouraged to have sex with females, make money by any means (selling drugs is the fastest and easiest means of making money), building a reputation is one of the most important and things one seeks. The easiest way is usually through violence.
   Street gangs are checker gangs until they are directed by one person that plays chess, making them a huge organization.
    <strong><em>'Gangster Disciples'</em></strong><a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd2i8Y2jyE> GDN Documentary</a>, Latin Kings, Bloods, and Crips all started as small street gangs.
   </p>
   
<p>As far as being a religious man, that came at an older age as. I never considered myself a Christian. It just never felt right and I had many questions.
  Everytime that I asked a question I was left with a lot more questions.
  I reverted during my time in prison. I’ve always wondered about Islam but I never looked deep into it.
  I didn’t understand that there were different groups that had different views, all claimed to be under the same Islamic umbrella.
  Islam is what I practice. A Muslim is who I am. A person that follows Islam. I am what one would describe as a <strong><em>”Sunni Muslim”</em></strong>.</p>
