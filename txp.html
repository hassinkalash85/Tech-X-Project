   <h1>Life Being Free After Ten Years</h1>
   <h2></h2>
   <p>Gang affiliation was at a very early age. I grew up around street and international gangs. I ended up being affiliated with both.
    Street gangs are usually where you live. You learn everything that happens in the streets from sitting and watching to being active in those activities. You can be a chilled dude that just gets on females, sell drugs, or be those that are violent to gain a reputation. And then you got those who do all three. Street gangs are checker gangs until they are directed by one person that plays chess, making them a huge organization. <em>'Gangster Disciples'</em> <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd2i8Y2jyE> youtube</a>, Latin Kings, and Crips all started as small street gangs.

   <p>As far as being a religious man that came at an older age as I was incarcerated. I never considered myself a Christian. It just never felt right and I had many questions. Everytime that I asked a question I was left with a lot more questions.
    I became a Muslim during my time in prison. I’ve always wondered about Islam but I never looked deeper into it. I didn’t understand that there were different groups that had different views but all claimed to be under the same umbrella. Islam is what I practice and a muslim is a person that follows islam. I am a <em>Sunni Muslimm</em> meaning one who follows the qur’an and lean in the way of Prophet Abdul Muhammad (not to get confused if Ilisha Muhammad). There are two supposed groups of muslim that are claimed here in American. They are the Nation Of Islam {The Nation of Islam - Documentary Short - YouTube} and The Moorish Science Temple of America {A Moorish Science Temple of America Documentary Film - YouTube}. These groups are both Black Nationalist. This isnt what islam teaches. Islam isn’t for one group or race. Islam is for all mankind.
