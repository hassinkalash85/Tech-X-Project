   <h1>Life Being Free After Ten Years</h1>
   <p>Gang affiliation was at a very early age. I grew up around street and international gangs. I ended up being affiliated with both.
    Street gangs are usually where you live. You learn everything that happens in the streets from sitting and watching to being active in those activities. You can be a chilled dude that just gets on females, sell drugs, or be those that are violent to gain a reputation. And then you got those who do all three. Street gangs are checker gangs until they are directed by one person that plays chess, making them a huge organization. <em>'Gangster Disciples'</em> {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd2i8Y2jyE}, Latin Kings, and Crips all started as small street gangs.
